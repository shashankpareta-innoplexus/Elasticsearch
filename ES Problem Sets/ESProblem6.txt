Sum aggregation on double values giving absurd values ??

/********  Solution   ************/

Case 1: This issue may be because of an issue in ES 1.x
"If two of your shards get a document at the same time, and one is mapped as a
long and the other one as a double, then the master node will reject the 2nd mapping
which is applied, but the shard with the wrong mapping will continue to index documents using the
wrong type. Usually, the problem becomes visible when nodes are moved around, because then
elasticsearch starts either interpreting some double bits as longs (and you would see huge number)
or long bits as double (and you would typically see tiny numbers, like here). When hit by this bug,
there is not other choice but to reindex. One way to prevent it from happening again in the future
would be to configure mappings explicitly.
On 2.0, this issue will be fixed as dynamic mappings will have to be validated on the
master node first before being applied. You can look at https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/106347
for more information. "

Case 2: Does it matter if I apply sum aggregation on field with long or double ?
The Sum Aggregation (and most of the numeric metric aggregations) compute results as a
double regardless of the field type.. To get a long value from this, you will need to do
the conversion from double to long in your application.

Case 3: Due to document duplication. In my case, first time the documents were indexed twice on server.
Due to this, I was getting average correct but sum was exactly twice. When I deleted index and reindexed,
problem was solved automatically.
