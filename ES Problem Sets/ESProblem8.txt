/***************  Problem *********/

There was a problem given by Pradumna that there are three documents with these name:
 Pradumna P
 Pradumna Panditrao
 P Panditrao

and case insensitive.
All should point to the same document i.e. Pradumna Panditrao.


/**************  Solution  ***********/

A custom analyzer with edgeNGram tokenizer, shingle and lowercase filter was formed and used it in mapping.
Data was reindexed and then used below queries:

GET author_list1/endo_author_list/_search
{
    "size": 0,
   "_source": [
      "name"
   ],
   "query": {
      "fuzzy": {
         "name.autocomplete": "s raut"
      }
   },
   "aggs": {
      "correct_name_aggs": {
         "terms": {
            "field": "name.raw",
            "order" : { "_term" : "desc" },
            "size" : 1
         }
      }
   }
}

However, it worked in my case. I need to see for other required cases too. I need to get into details
of how fuzzy query works to find out upto what level this solution works.

Mapping is named autocomplete.json and it is in mappings folder.
