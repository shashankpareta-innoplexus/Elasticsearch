/***************  Problem *********/

There was a problem given by Pradumna that
 Pradumna P
 Pradumna Panditrao
 P Panditrao

and case insensitive.
All should point to the same document.


/**************  Solution  ***********/

A custom analyzer with nGram tokenizer, shingle and lowercase filter was formed and used it in mapping.
Data was reindexed and then we simply used match query to get desired results.

Mapping is named point_to_same_document.json and it is in mappings folder.
