/**********   Problem  ************/

In case of .raw query, if there is case (lowercase and uppercase) difference
between  stored data and queried data, then it will not match i.e. it becomes
case sensitive. This was a problem faced by Pradumna.


/*********  Solution  **********/

I made a modification in mapping of .raw field. The problem was .raw field was not
analyzed so it will not even takes standard analyzer which has lowercase tokenizer.
So, query on .raw field fails even for lowercase or uppercase.
Proposed solution is replace index=not_analyzed with a custom analyzer with keyword tokenizer
and lowercase filter. Keyword tokenizer does not break tokens like standard rather it takes
entire field as one token but converts that into lowercase. Now, we can use same queries as
before on.raw field and it should work.

Mapping is given in LowercaseFilterproblem.json in mappings folder
