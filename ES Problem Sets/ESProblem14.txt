/*************  Problem  ************/

I wish to get only those documents that has a given phrase. For example,
I want to get those documents that has "Lung Cancer" together in it. match_phrase query
fails as it gives those documents also that has lung and cancer but far way and
not together.


/************ Solution 1  ***************/

{
"query": {
       "match_phrase": {
          "abstract": {
              "query": "unphosphorylated kinase",
              "slop" : "0"
          }
       }
    }
}

Now here, I used slop with match_phrase query. Slop is used for proximity searches.
Slop = 0 means that the gap between two words should not be more than 0.


/***********  Solution 2   ****************/

{
   "query": {
       "query_string": {
          "results_abstract.data.abstract": {
              "query": "\"activity against\""
          }
       }
   }
}

There is some problem  with this solution. It does not always give desired results.
This is simple Query String query.
