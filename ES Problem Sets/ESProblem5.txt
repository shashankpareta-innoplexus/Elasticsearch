/************  Problem ********/

How to alter size of query so that we get all responses rather than only top 10 by default?

/*********** Solution ********/

I think its not possible in one single query, the feasible solution is to get hits in first query and then
again request to  get all results. One more solution is to use Scroll API provided by ES. However,
it is suggested not to use it in real time requests but preferred only for processing large data sets
i.e. for reindexing.



/*********** Problem *********/

Can we alter fieldname in Elasticsearch ?

/*********** Solution ********/

Field name can't  be changed. We will have to delete our index, create the mapping with the name
we want, and re-index our data.
