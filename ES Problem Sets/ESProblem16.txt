/***************   Problem   **************/

For matching multiple items from a particular field, terms query is used. Problem is
it matches exactly to the indexed data i.e. if you entered "shashank" then it will not
match if in index "Shashank" is stored. Thus, search is case sensitive.


/***************   Solution   *************/

Thus to make it case insensitive, match query is used in place of terms query. Let's
see, how it is possible:

Indexed data: shashank, pareta, sanjay

terms query:
{
    "query": {
        "terms": {
           "FIELD": [
              "shashank",
              "Pareta",
              "sanjay"
           ]
        }
    }
}


match query:
{
    "query": {
        "match": {
           "FIELD": {
               "query": ["shashank", "sanjay", "Pareta"],
               "operator": "or"
           }
        }
    }
}


here for above case, terms query will fail but match query will work.
