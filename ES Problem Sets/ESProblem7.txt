/**********  Problem  ***************/

In kols_endo_author_list named database given by Pradumna, match_phrase_prefix was not giving
desired results for autocomplete on name field.


/********** Solution  **************/

A custom analyzer with edgeNGram tokenizer, shingle and lowercase filter was formed and used it in mapping.
Data was reindexed and then we simply used match query to get desired results.

Mapping is named name_autocomplete.json and it is in mappings folder.
