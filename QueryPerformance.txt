Suggestions for improving ES performance

1. Get only those source which are required. Reduce network bandwidth.
2. Use aliases instead of index for querying
3. Avoid excessively large mapping as this can add significant overhead while performing searches,
   consumes lot of memory (Mapping explosion).
4. Use not_analyzed to avoid tokenization.
5. Use doc_values per property basis i.e. disable doc_values for those fields where aggregation is
   not performed. Not applicable for analyzed fields.
6. Enable shard request caching by using:
    PUT /index_name/_settings
    {
      "index.requests.enable" : true
    }
7. Use replicas but too much replica also adds a overhead.
8. Never use wildcard queries
9. In case of multifield use store because that field might be used again and again.
10. Use filters before query as it matches on yes/no basis and also cache results
11. Use bool filters.
12. Avoid aggregations on analyzed fields.
13. Avoid scripting. These are expensive and not cached.
