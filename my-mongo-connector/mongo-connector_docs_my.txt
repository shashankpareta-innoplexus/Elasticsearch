Installation and Getting started steps:

1. pip install mongo-connector

2. now create a replica set in mongoDB. Here you may face a problem.
So write this in mongo client window:
rs.initiate({_id:"yourReplSetName", members: [{"_id":1, "host":"yourHost:yourPort"}]}),
where yourhost is localhost and port is 27017 if you are running on local machine

3. Create a database in mongodb that you want to sync with elasticsearch.

4. Mongo-connector replicates to ElastiSearch using Elastic doc manager. Before mongo-connector
version < 2.3, the elastic doc manager was packaged as a part of mongo-connector. But for
version > 2.3, doc managers for 1.x and 2.x are available as plugins.
Follow this link for doc manager. 1.x (https://github.com/mongodb-labs/elastic-doc-manager) and
2.x (https://github.com/mongodb-labs/elastic2-doc-manager).

5. Now run this in another terminal:
  mongo-connector -m localhost:27017 -t localhost:9200 -d elastic2_doc_manager mongo-connector -m localhost:27017 -t localhost:9200 -d elastic2_doc_manager -n db_name.collection_name

6. You will see that mongoDB and elasticsearch are synced.


Issues:
1. In mongo-connector, every time we change index or mongoDB that we want to sync,
we need to remove oplog.timestamp file. However, sometimess it wasn't working even after
removing oplog.timestamp file.

2. Data indexing using monngo-connector was not working with dynamic mapping defined.
