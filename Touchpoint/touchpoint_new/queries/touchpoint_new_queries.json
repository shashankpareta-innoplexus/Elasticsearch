Query: For autocomplete of filters
GET kols_filters/onco_filter_data_1/_search
{
    "query": {
        "match": {
           "field_name.autocomplete": "Pal"
        }
    }
}

Query: Query on aliases rather than on index. This will reduce downtime to nearly zero
Case 1: Simple use cases of alias with one index
add one index --
POST _aliases
{
    "actions": [
       {
          "add": {
             "index": "index1",
             "alias": "alias1"
          }
       }
    ]
}

query on alias with index1--
GET alias1/type_name/_search
{
    "query":{}
}

Replace index1 with new one --
POST _aliases
{
    "actions": [
       {
           "remove": {
             "index": "old_index_name",
             "alias": "alias1"
           },
          "add": {
             "index": "new_index_name",
             "alias": "alias1"
          }
       }
    ]
}


Case 2: Make a filtered alias.
Let's say we have a data of 10lakh documents. It has a country field filter which has four countries:
Canada, France, Germany and USA. Now, requirement is that we want distinct author names of Canada.
Then there are two ways to do it:
First is to first filter on countries in query and then apply aggregation.
Second is by aliases. What we can do is we can create an alias that points to those documents of
that index which has canada in their country name. Then in query time we can just query on that alias.
Now, we will not have to filter countries in query.
Example:

POST _aliases
{
    "actions": [
       {
          "add": {
             "index": ["index1"],
             "alias": "alias1",
             "filter": {
                 "term": {
                    "country": "canada"
                 }
             }
          }
       }
    ]
}


Case 3: Add multiple indices to an alias.
We can add many indices to an alias and then we can query on that alias. This will
help me in querying multiple indices at once.

POST _aliases
{
    "actions": [
       {
          "add": {
             "index": ["kols_onco_publications","kols_onco_congresses"],
             "alias": "alias1"
          }
       }
    ]
}
